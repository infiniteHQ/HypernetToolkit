### Introduction

Similar to the rest of the architecture, the entire communication aspect is entirely programmable. In general, we will categorize communications into two main groups: notifications, allowing elements to organize, program, and negotiate the components to use, data formatting, security, and communications. The second major group is transmissions, used to convey concrete application data.

#### Elaboration and Clarification:

The communication aspect within Hypernet is designed to be highly flexible and customizable. It can be broadly classified into two significant categories:

- Notifications: This category encompasses communications that facilitate organization, programming, and negotiation among elements. It includes aspects such as determining which components to use, data formatting, ensuring security measures, and managing general communications within the network.

- Transmissions: The second category involves communications used to transmit tangible application data. This includes the actual exchange of information relevant to specific applications or services within the Hypernet matrix.

By categorizing communication into these two groups, Hypernet provides a structured and adaptable framework that can be tailored to various use cases and scenarios. Elements can effectively manage both organizational aspects and the transmission of application-specific data within the programmable communication infrastructure.

### Custom Communication

A third type of communication exists, known as custom communication. It involves giving the user complete control over how transmissions are carried out. This approach is more akin to traditional networking.

#### Elaboration and Example:

Custom communication within Hypernet provides users with the flexibility to define and control the transmission methods according to their specific preferences or requirements. Unlike the structured categories of notifications and transmissions, custom communication allows users to implement networking approaches that suit their unique needs.

For instance, a user might choose to employ a specific communication protocol, encryption method, or data transmission format based on the particular characteristics of their application or network. This level of customization empowers users to tailor communication methods to align with established networking practices or to implement innovative approaches that best fit their use case within the Hypernet framework.
