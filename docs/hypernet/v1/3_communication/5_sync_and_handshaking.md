# Handshaking

## Introduction

### Goal?
The goal of a controlled handshaking is to enable elements to work together despite differences in technology, operation, or interpretation. It is the key to federating services among themselves. Handshaking allows elements to agree on security methods to adopt and apply, the formatting of transmissions, the technologies to prioritize, and more.




## Hypernet Standard Library Definitions
The theory provides crucial information about the modular functioning of handshaking & syncronization. Now, let's explore more practically how Hypernet's standard library implements this theory. To implement everything we have seen and will see, refer to the documentation and tutorials of the Hypernet Toolkit.

Comming soon :)
