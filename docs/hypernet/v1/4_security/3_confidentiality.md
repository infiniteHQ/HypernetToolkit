# Confidentiality

*Note: The specification of the Hypernet Security Protocol is still a work in progress; contents are subject to changes.*

## Introduction

### Why ?
Ensuring the confidentiality of transmissions is a crucial aspect to provide users with a secure and safe environment. Encryption adds an additional layer of protection to safeguard sensitive information and maintain the integrity of data. By implementing secure encryption measures, Hypernet enhances the overall security posture, addressing concerns related to unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential cyber threats. This commitment to data security contributes to creating a trustworthy and resilient technological ecosystem for users.


### Confidentiality of Infrastructure
Through its design and decentralization, Hypernet is not directly accessible via the web (depending on the architecture chosen by the user), making it a significant strength. Unlike traditional centralized systems, where a malicious actor could attempt to compromise a service hosted in Chicago from Madrid, Hypernet's decentralization requires physical presence to attempt to compromise the same service in Chicago. This geographical dependency, coupled with additional security measures, enhances the robustness of the infrastructure and contributes to maintaining the confidentiality and security of the system.


### Confidentiality of Communications
Hypernet provides a framework for confidentiality in all communications within matrices and channels. This is established either through the properties of the matrix or the channel, delivering confidentiality information to communicating elements, or through a handshake between elements (if allowed by the matrix). This approach ensures a secure and private environment for communication within the Hypernet ecosystem.

## Hypernet Standard Library Definitions

The theory provides crucial information about the modular functioning of confidentiality. Now, let's explore more practically how Hypernet's standard library implements this theory. To implement everything we have seen and will see, refer to the documentation and tutorials of the Hypernet Toolkit.
