# Application

## Introduction

### Why
In addition to communication security (such as HSP or TLS), having impeccable application security is crucial. If communication is secure but the application is vulnerable, the entire house of cards collapses. This emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive approach to security, addressing both communication and application layers to establish a robust and resilient defense against potential threats and vulnerabilities.

### Secure Data & Runtime

It is crucial to provide a dedicated context for the security of the application and its runtime. This focused approach ensures that both data and the runtime environment are secure, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities and potential exploits. By establishing a secure foundation for the application and its runtime, Hypernet enhances the overall security posture and resilience of the system against potential security threats.


## Hypernet Standard Library Definitions

The theory provides crucial information about the modular functioning of application security. Now, let's explore more practically how Hypernet's standard library implements this theory. To implement everything we have seen and will see, refer to the documentation and tutorials of the Hypernet Toolkit.
