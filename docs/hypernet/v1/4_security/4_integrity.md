## Introduction 

### Why ?
Integrity is a fundamental aspect of any network or application. It involves ensuring that the state of a matrix, channel, or element is always accurate and pure, without modification due to malicious actions. Maintaining integrity is crucial for the trustworthiness and reliability of the entire system, preventing unauthorized alterations and preserving the intended functionality of each component within the Hypernet framework.

### Integrity of Matrices & Channels
Thanks to concepts such as authentication and encryption, numerous methods ensure the integrity of a channel or matrix. These mechanisms play a vital role in guaranteeing that the state and data within matrices and channels remain unaltered and secure. Authentication protocols verify the legitimacy of entities interacting with these components, while encryption safeguards against unauthorized tampering, collectively ensuring the integrity of matrices and channels within the Hypernet environment.

### Integrity of Datas
Data integrity is fundamental to ensuring its reliability from the source to processing. Maintaining the integrity of data involves safeguarding against any unauthorized modifications or corruption, ensuring that the information remains accurate and unaltered throughout its lifecycle. This is crucial for building trust in the data and its usability, especially as it traverses various stages within the Hypernet environment.


## Hypernet Standard Library Definitions

The theory provides crucial information about the modular functioning of integrity. Now, let's explore more practically how Hypernet's standard library implements this theory. To implement everything we have seen and will see, refer to the documentation and tutorials of the Hypernet Toolkit.
