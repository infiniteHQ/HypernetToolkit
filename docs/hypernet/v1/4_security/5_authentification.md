Authentification
----

### Why ?
To prevent malicious activities related to usurpation within a network, matrix, or channel, strong authentication is required. This ensures the authentication and certification of a matrix and its contents and elements. By implementing robust authentication measures, Hypernet strengthens its defenses against unauthorized access, protecting the integrity and trustworthiness of the entire system.

### Authentication of Elements
For each element, Hypernet must ensure the provision of an authentication framework to ensure that each element is certain about the identity of the entity it is communicating with. This is why the paradigm encompasses various authentication concepts for elements, based on encrypted keys and certificates. By employing these secure authentication methods, Hypernet establishes a trustworthy environment where elements can communicate with confidence, confident in the legitimacy of their counterparts.

### Authentication of Matrices & Channels
Similar to integrity, matrices and channels serve as meeting points for elements. Thus, it is extremely important to secure them to assure elements that they are indeed present in the correct matrix and channels. Robust authentication mechanisms for matrices and channels play a pivotal role in verifying the legitimacy of the entities interacting within these components, ensuring the trustworthiness and reliability of the overall Hypernet system.
