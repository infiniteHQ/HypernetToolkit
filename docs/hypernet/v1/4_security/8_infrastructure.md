## Introduction

### Robust Infrastructure
To ensure an effective stability of the overall security in the use case, making the right choices in terms of infrastructure and the way elements communicate is crucial. A robust infrastructure lays the foundation for a secure and reliable environment, minimizing potential points of failure and enhancing the overall resilience of the system against security threats.

The theory provides crucial information about the modular functioning of infrastructure security. Now, let's explore more practically how Hypernet's standard library implements this theory. To implement everything we have seen and will see, refer to the documentation and tutorials of the Hypernet Toolkit.
