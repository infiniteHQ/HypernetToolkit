# Architecture

## Introduction

### Importance of a Good Architecture
The paradigm offers the flexibility to meticulously choose the architecture for matrices, channels, element management, linkage, and communication. This enables the easy adaptation of an architecture, even a complex one, to specific security requirements. A well-designed architecture is crucial for establishing a secure and adaptable environment within Hypernet, allowing users to tailor the system to meet precise security needs effectively.


## Hypernet Standard Library Definitions

The theory provides crucial information about the modular functioning of architecture security. Now, let's explore more practically how Hypernet's standard library implements this theory. To implement everything we have seen and will see, refer to the documentation and tutorials of the Hypernet Toolkit.
