Hypernet Toolkit (HTK)
=====

----

### What is Hypernet Toolkit (HTK) ?
Hypernet Toolkit (HTK) is a comprehensive and official implementation of Hypernet. It provides all the necessary tools to build complete solutions based on the Hypernet framework. The library is designed to be complete, free of unnecessary features (bloat-free), versatile, and portable.

The primary library is written in C++, and there are plans to create wrappers for more high-level programming languages, making it accessible and usable across a variety of development environments.


### You can easely manipulate the Hypernet paradigm
The Hypernet Toolkit enables you to create, manipulate, integrate, or evolve an infrastructure or application around the concepts of decentralization, federation, integration, and implementation to reap all the benefits of Hypernet (see "Goals" and "Use cases").

This technical implementation of Hypernet is designed to be extremely simple and minimalist. The goal is not only to simplify development but also to have minimal impact on the use case.
