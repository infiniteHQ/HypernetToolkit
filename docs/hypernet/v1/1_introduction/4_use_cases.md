Use cases
=====


### Data & User
Data, users, and associated services are focal points of interest for Hypernet and its paradigm. The goal is to establish a safe, secure, and healthy context for all within this use case. This involves maintaining controlled data management and providing users with the ability to regain control and ownership of their data through the principles of decentralization.

### Networking & Platforms
Hypernet and its paradigm enable tailored networking for specific needs. Whether it's transmitting a data stream, subscribing devices to events, or making decisions based on temperature data, Hypernet addresses each challenge by providing the capability to modularize and program the technology at its core.

### Industry & Systems
Numerous challenges and needs exist in the industry, including system security, service reliability, real-time requirements, and fundamental principles such as system and data redundancy, as well as service maintenance or recovery after an incident. Hypernet provides an efficient and qualitative framework in the administration of services and application quality.

### Accessibility
Thanks to the concepts of federation and integration, the paradigm makes it easy to adapt an environment to its users while providing concrete solutions for people with reduced mobility through automation. It also optimizes the accessibility of an infrastructure in general. The ability to integrate AI in a decentralized manner directly within the environment further enhances these capabilities.

### DÃ©centralized Services & Applications
The Hypernet paradigm enables the creation of decentralized applications and services, bringing forth numerous new possibilities such as user environment interaction, data decentralization, object integration, service federation, and more. This aims to provide solutions to various security, efficiency, and quality challenges.

### Games
This technology is applicable in various domains, and another example is the world of video games. This industry can benefit from technical potential in terms of networking, session management, synchronization, and player interactions. Hypernet allows for the adoption of a simple, secure, yet powerful networking solution in the gaming landscape.
