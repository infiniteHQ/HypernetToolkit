# Actors

## Introduction

### What is an Actor?

An actor is an active element, which can be a user, a bot, or an AI. It directly influences the network, unlike other types of elements that may be passive or static. Actors are elements!

#### Elaboration and Examples:
In the context of Hypernet, an Actor is a dynamic and actively participating element within the network. It can take various forms, including:

- User: An individual actively engaged in communication, interaction, or the execution of tasks within the network is considered an Actor.

- Bot: Automated bots designed to perform specific functions, respond to queries, or execute predefined actions are also categorized as Actors.

- AI: Artificial intelligence entities that actively contribute to data analysis, decision-making, or learning processes within the network are recognized as Actors.

Actors distinguish themselves by their direct impact on the network's dynamics. They initiate actions, contribute to the exchange of information, and play an active role in shaping the overall behavior of the Hypernet matrix.

## Hypernet Standard Library Definitions

The theory provides crucial information about the modular functioning of actors. Now, let's explore more practically how Hypernet's standard library implements this theory. To implement everything we have seen and will see, refer to the documentation and tutorials of the Hypernet Toolkit.
