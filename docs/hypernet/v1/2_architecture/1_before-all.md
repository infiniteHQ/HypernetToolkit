### Introduction

Hypernet aims to be a fully flexible and programmable technology designed for adaptability in any situation. Its protocols are entirely flexible, offering versatility to be tailored for any domain. Therefore, Hypernet can be utilized for raw data management, sensor data retrieval, or authentication and user management. In essence, Hypernet can be adapted to any use case, showcasing an innovative capacity for adaptability.

### Paradigm

As stated in the introduction, Hypernet's paradigm differs from traditional networking solutions. This solution introduces novel concepts related to the decentralization of data and associated services, along with their federation. It involves the integration of the environment and various objects or services.


### Flexible, Programmable, Modular

The primary goal is to provide significant programming potential. The theories and practices have been developed around the aspect of modularization, allowing the choice of transmission protocol, network layer, and technology employed. Additionally, programming is a key feature, providing the ability to fully program network behaviors. Finally, the flexibility allows for easy adaptation of infrastructure or applications to specific needs.

### Communication
Hypernet communications are programmable, allowing them to be tailored for data transmission. This can be achieved in various formats such as temperature, pressure, speed, or audio and video streams. They can be programmed to be interpreted in a specific manner, fully adapting to the application they serve (refer to the entire communication section).

In general, two main types of communications can be observed: the section covering negotiation, organization, context, and interoperability (notifications), and the section focusing on application transmission (transmissions).


### Architecture

The network architecture of Hypernet technology doesn't adhere to a traditional "Client/Server" or "Peer-to-Peer" model. Hypernet is, in fact, a mesh network (which can be adapted to a conventional network as needed) with the capability to include internal control agents within the network, referred to as "Authorities."

A Hypernet network consists of numerous points called "elements" (applications, services, systems, users) rather than devices, as seen in an IP or internet protocol network.

Three types of points communicate within the Hypernet network: the receiver, the transmitter, and the emitter.

    - The receiver receives a communication intended for it.
    - The transmitter conveys a communication from one point to another.
    - The emitter sends a communication to a specific point.

It's important to note that the Internet comprises four fundamental types of communication: transmissions, notifications, and custom communications.

Starting with notifications and transmissions, their content can be adapted and programmed according to specific needs.

### Security
Just like everything else, the security principles are entirely programmable and adjustable to easily adapt to specific use cases. Speaking of security, Hypernet's security can be tailored to any use case, including cryptography, and so on.
