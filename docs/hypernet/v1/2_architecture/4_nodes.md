### What is a Node?

A node is a potential connection between two elements, representing a physical possibility of communication. One or more channels can be established between these nodes.

#### Clarification and Elaboration:
In the context of Hypernet, a node serves as a potential link between two elements within the system. It signifies a tangible opportunity for communication between these elements. The establishment of one or more channels facilitates the actual communication process, allowing data, information, or signals to flow between the connected nodes.

The concept of a node highlights the fundamental building block for communication within Hypernet, emphasizing the physical connectivity possibilities inherent in the network.


## Hypernet Standard Library Definitions

The theory provides crucial information about the modular functioning of nodes. Now, let's explore more practically how Hypernet's standard library implements this theory. To implement everything we have seen and will see, refer to the documentation and tutorials of the Hypernet Toolkit.
