# Channels

## Introduction

### What is a Channel?

A channel is a transmission stream between two elements within a matrix, and it must be defined on one or more nodes. If element A is connected via Ethernet, element B is connected via WiFi/IP and Bluetooth, and element C is connected via Bluetooth, a channel can be defined between A and C. A channel is defined between two peers with specific configurations set by these same pairs.

#### Clarification and Elaboration:
In the Hypernet context, a channel serves as a conduit for data transmission between two elements within a matrix. It is a pathway that allows information to flow between connected entities. It's essential to note that a channel is inherently associated with one or more nodes, indicating the physical or potential connections between elements.

For example, if element A is connected via Ethernet, element B is connected via both WiFi/IP and Bluetooth, and element C is connected via Bluetooth, a channel could be established between A and C. The definition of a channel involves specific configurations set by the connected pairs, emphasizing a tailored and precise communication link between the two elements involved.


### Goals of a Channel
The goal of a channel is to provide a communicative context, allowing all elements composing this channel to agree on how to exchange information, the nature of the data, how to identify the data, how to process it, how to secure it, and more.

### Bootstrapping
Similar to the matrix, there are numerous ways to bootstrap a channel. The matrix can be programmed to automatically include new elements in a channel to optimize various operations (for embedded devices, for example). The matrix can also be programmed to manage the creation of a channel and the inclusion of users in it (for larger applications).

We can also envision a regulatory authority within the matrix to secure access to channels and the exchanges that occur within them.

### Flexible Aspects

Similar to all other components within Hypernet, a channel is programmable and modular, allowing for the adaptation of the nature of the data to be transmitted (such as sensor data, audio or video streams, environmental events, or files, for example). Additionally, it is possible to program the encryption method to be used, the security infrastructure to employ, or the manner in which connections are managed.

This flexibility ensures that the channel can be customized to meet specific requirements, accommodating a diverse range of data types and security considerations based on the unique needs of the application or system. The programmability and modularity of Hypernet's channels contribute to the adaptability and versatility of the overall network architecture.

## Hypernet Standard Library Definitions

The theory provides crucial information about the modular functioning of channels. Now, let's explore more practically how Hypernet's standard library implements this theory. To implement everything we have seen and will see, refer to the documentation and tutorials of the Hypernet Toolkit.
